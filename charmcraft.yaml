  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing [haproxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) on machines.
  
  HAProxy is a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy which is particularly suited for high
  availability environments. It features connection persistence through HTTP
  cookies, load balancing, header addition, modification, deletion both ways. It
  has request blocking capabilities and provides interface to display server
  status.

  This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of haproxy on 
  VMs and bare metal.
summary: Fast and reliable load balancing reverse proxy.
