  - title: Render retry configuration in template and remove retry_interval attribute
    author: Thanhphan1147
    type: minor
    description: |
      The `retry_interval` attribute has been removed since there's no way to configure that in HAproxy.
      To configure the time between 2 retries we can use `timeout.connect`.
