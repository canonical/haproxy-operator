title: Enable merging multiple TCP backends on the same port with SNI routing
author: tphan025

description: >
  Added support for merging multiple TCP backends requesting the same port to a single frontend.
  Backends that don't meet routing requirements (missing SNI or enforce_tls=False) are filtered out
  and tracked as invalid. Furthermore, backends with tls_terminate=True have priority when merging.
