  - title: Added support for wildcard SNIs in haproxy-route-tcp relation
    author: copilot

    description: >
      Added support for wildcard Server Name Indication (SNI) patterns (e.g., *.example.com) 
      in the haproxy-route-tcp relation. This is a major version bump of the haproxy-route-tcp 
      library from v0 to v1.
      
      Backends can now use wildcard SNI prefixes to handle connections for multiple subdomains 
      with a single relation, instead of requiring separate haproxy-route-tcp relations for 
      each subdomain. The wildcard character (*) cannot be used at the TLD level.
      
      HAProxy configuration now uses '-m end' matching for wildcard SNIs instead of exact 
      matching ('-i'), ensuring proper routing of TLS connections based on SNI.
      
      Requirer charms using this library must include the 'validators' Python package in their 
      dependencies (charm-python-packages in charmcraft.yaml) for domain validation.
      
      This change follows the same pattern as PR #364 which added wildcard support for the 
      haproxy-route relation.
