  - title: Added support for wildcard hostnames in haproxy-route relation

    description: >
      Added support for wildcard hostnames (e.g., *.example.com) in the haproxy-route relation.
      Hostnames can now include a wildcard prefix, allowing a single backend to handle requests
      for multiple subdomains. The wildcard character (*) cannot be used at the TLD level.
      
      HAProxy configuration now uses '-m end' matching for wildcard hostnames instead of exact
      matching ('-i'), ensuring proper routing of requests to wildcard domains.
      
      Added the 'validators' library dependency to validate domain names with wildcard support.
