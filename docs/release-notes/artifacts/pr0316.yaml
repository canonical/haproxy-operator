    description: |
      Refactor terraform/charm, so the modules are under a subdirectory, one per charm.
      Add terraform charm module for `haproxy-spoe-auth`.
      Update terraform product module to include the options to protect hostnames and
      have the option to deploy the `oauth-external-idp-integrator` if the configuration
      is given.
