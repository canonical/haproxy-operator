    description: |
      Added sensible security defaults to prevent basic DDoS attacks.
      By default, basic DDoS protection mechanisms are enabled, including
      http-request, http-keep-alive and client timeouts, automatic dropping of connections
      with invalid, empty, or missing host headers.
      A new config option `ddos-protection` has been added to enable basic DDoS protections
      if needed.
