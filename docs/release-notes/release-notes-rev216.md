## Updates

The following major and minor features were added in this release.

### Add consistent hashing support

Consistent hashing reduce redistribution of clients to another backend server when server is added/removed. On HAProxy it will add 
```
hash-type consistent
```
to the configuration.

* [PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/149)


### Validated requirer relation data object

Validation is now done on both the requirer and provider side to check
for invalid characters. On the requirer an exception will be raised
while on the provider the related service will be ignored.

* [PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/118)


### Updated integration tests

The integration tests now only run one unit to save CI time.

### Updated certifications handling

The charm now requests a new certification for each subdomain during initialization.

### Refactored source code and tests

Several changes to the source code, integration tests, and unit tests.
The reconcile function was broken into smaller modules, mode validation is
now performed in a state in the charm class, some tests were migrated to jubilant,
and other tests were moved to different directories.

* [PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/158)


### Added a new relation

Added the `ingress-per-unit` relation to support reaching each
unit separately for a Vault deployed behind an ingress.

### Rendered `retry` configuration in template and remove `retry_interval` attribute

The `retry_interval` attribute has been removed since there's no way to configure that in HAProxy.
To configure the time between 2 retries we can use `timeout.connect`.

and `additional_hostnames` attribute. The charm now sends an
empty list as the `proxied_endpoints` when the requirer data
is ignored.

## Bug fixes

* Added missing new lines in haproxy-route j2 template and added missing `unit_address` in `provide_haproxy_route_requirements` helper method ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/128)).
* Pinned the HAProxy version and prevented automatic updates ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/136)).
* Disabled sending host headers in `httpchk` so the charm doesn't refuse to proxy incoming requests ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/111)).
* Added checks before reloading the HAProxy service and set the charm to waiting if the validation fails ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/122)).
* Fixed a typo in the cookie fetch method in the load-balancing algorithm ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/179)).
* Added a new dependency to fix the linting step ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/105)).
* Added "s" suffix to timeout entries ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/162)).
* Fixed Jinja2 handling of newlines to prevent invalid configuration generation ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/139)).
* Mitigated bug in Terraform provider by setting subordinate charm units to `1` ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/135)).
* Fixed an ambiguous endpoint in an integration test ([PR](https://github.com/canonical/haproxy-operator/pull/129)).
